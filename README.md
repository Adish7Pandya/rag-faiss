# RAG with FAISS

This project implements a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) model integrated with FAISS (Facebook AI Similarity Search) for efficient vector-based similarity search and retrieval. It enhances text generation by retrieving relevant documents from a large knowledge base.

## Features

- Vector indexing and search using FAISS for fast retrieval
- Integration with a generative model to produce context-aware responses
- Easy to set up and run

## Installation

1. Clone the repository or download the zip file and unzip it.
2. Install required Python packages:```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt


## Usage

```bash
python main.py
```

## Fil
- `data/sample_docs.txt`: Sample knowledge base.
- `src/`: Python modules for embedding, building the FAISS index, retrieval, and generation.
- `main.py`: Entry point to the pipeline.
